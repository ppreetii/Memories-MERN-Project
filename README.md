# Memories-MERN-App
Memories is a CRUD, responsive web app designed using MERN stack. It is a simple social media app where people can post pictures, edit and delete their post and, like otherâ€™s posts.

Problem Definition: This application was built to use my knowledge of MERN app in one application.I used my lesson of file destructuring(both frontend and backend), that is a part of a IT project in a company.
